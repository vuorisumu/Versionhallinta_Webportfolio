      <h2>PROFILE</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Patrick Palmroos and I'm a student at the Tampere
        University of applied sciences. I'm studying for a Bachelor of Business
        Administration degree. In english that means programming. I am currently
        on my second year of studying and I'm specialising in software
        engineering. I love taking on new challenges and learning new things!
        I'm quick at learning and love to work with a team but I also enjoy
        working on my own! I am very social and get by well with everyone!

        <dd>
          I worked in the Lahti at Prisma Syke for over 7 months as a part-time
          employee. I mainly manned cash register but I also did product
          unloading from time to time. I worked during alot of rush hours and
          handled hundreds of customers professionally even during the most
          stressful times. I guided customers, helped with problem situations
          and ran the information counter at times with great co-workers.

          I worked at the Linnainmaa K-Citymarket for roughly 8 months. Like
          earlier, I manned the cash register but also did alot of information
          counter work which included handling customer packages, handling
          veikkaus, selling event tickets, handling returns and planning the
          employee timetable for the next day to count a few. Along with these
          responsibilities I had the opportunity to work with some amazing
          people along the way!

          our customers property and employees safety by doing different types
          of surveillance. I have met some great people during my time with
          Securitas and I've had the opportunity to experience work that differs
          alot from anything I've experienced before!
